Combinations: are like subsets as we seeb before	/formed by including/not including

How many subsets in element of n?
2*2*2*2*2....ntimes = 2^n	(2 subsets for 1 element multiplied for each)
	for ex what combinations of  [2,4] : itereations?4 : null , 2 , 4 , [2,4] 
	
	Advance
		What these subsets actually are?***
			(dont include2 ,  dont include 4) , (include 2 ,  dont include 4) , (dont include 2, include 4) , (include 2, include 4) 
	What is a subset? all possible groups formed by including and not including elements of set

permutation: places are fixed and must be occupied
for 8 string
permutations = movement among those 8 places

All permutations of a string?
		for n length string
		1st letter : n choices
		2nd letter : n-1 choice
		...nth letter: : 1
			total choices = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)....1 = n!

NOTE: REMEMBER EVERYTHING IS A MATTER OF CHOICES
