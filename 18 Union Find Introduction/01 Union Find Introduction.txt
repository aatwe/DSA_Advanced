What is Union Find?
Data structure Also Called as Disjoint set
	what does it do? tracks elements
		any special type of elements? 
		  elements split into 1 or more disjoint sets
				for ex
		14 Magnets
		all attracted to each other
		all want to merge and form some configuration
		
We unify magnets into groups
		unionFind(6,8,9)	    //Blue group
		unionFind(2,3,4) 	    //Yellow Group
		unionFind(10,13,14)   //Purple group

if we unifyGroup(Blue and Yellow , Blue) -> assign union group blue color
	If we do look up -> can find blue group contains all 6

Why use unionFind()? It does merging and finding in efficient way

What operations on union find?
	a) find()
	
	b) union()


What use case:

A)  Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
	Basically:

B) Grid Perlocation
	Dots on grid, 
	Check if there  is path from bottom to top or vice versa
	UnionFind helps find path  efficiently using multiple paths

C) Network Connectivity

D) Least common ancestor in trees


E) Image Processing
