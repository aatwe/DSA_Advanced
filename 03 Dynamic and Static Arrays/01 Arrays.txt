Q) How to represent index of an array? []

	A[0] = 44;	//44 value of element at position 0 in array A
	A[1] = 12;
	A[9] => Out of bound element

Q) How to assign array an element?
	A[0] := -1;

Q) Why array used so much?  data structures building block
	Can construct any data structure with array and pointer

Q) What is static array?
	fixed length container
	n elements
	all adjacent
	indexable: 0 to n-1
		indexable? reference for each element
	
	
Q) Where and when to use static array? 	
	a) store objects temporarily
	b) store input/output stream information
		in a buffer	//reading file in chunks

	c) look up tables : can index
	d) in programming lang
		if allowed only to return 1 values -> can return pointer/reference to an array  

	e) Dynamic programming
		tabulate cache/store already computed subproblems
	   for ex knapsack problem / coin change problem


Q) What is time complexity of static array and dynamic array?

	Static		Dynamic
Access	O(1)		O(1)	//why 1? arrays are indexable //can directly since we know index
Search     O(n)		O(n)	//searching a number? linear  worst case last element
Insert	NA		O(n)	//static: cant grow, so no point to insert	//dynamic: worst case shift all to right , linear
Append	NA		O(1)	//static: cant grow, so no point to append          // dynamic (using static) resize then append -> constant time
Delete	NA		O(n)	//cant grow, so no point to delete	'	//similar to insertion, have to shift elements ,and recopy everything


Note: Dynamic array isnt strictly defined data structure
	for ex dynamic array using a linked list	
	if it keeps pointer to element

Note: Appending is done at the end
		
Note: How to access elements in an array? by their index
					Any other way to access elements? No, 
					indexing: 0 based
					 In Computer science : element is positioned at index 0
