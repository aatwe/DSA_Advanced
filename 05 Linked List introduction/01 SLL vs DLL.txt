Singly Linked list vs Doubly Linked List

a) SLL : only 1 pointer to next node
	Pro?	Use less memory (1 pointer < 2 pointers)
		(pointers take lot memory, @64 bit references use 8 bytes)

	Con?	cannot access previous element
b) DLL : 2 pointers : 1 to next node, 1 to previous node
	Pro? can traverse back
	         can remove node in O(1) and patch up hole
	
	Con? uses twice memory
