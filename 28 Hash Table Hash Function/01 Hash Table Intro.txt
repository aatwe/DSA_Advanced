 What is hash table? One data structure to rule them all


data structure
	helps to map keys to values
	How to map? hashing
	
Key - value : can be any value
can we map string -> no.? yes

Key must be unique, Key must be hashable
values dont have to be unique


Where is hash table commonly used?
	Track Item frequencies
	for ex frequency of words in Hamlet
	1) 	hamlet		114
		ghost		33
		the		1151
		lord		223
		a		550
		cabbage		null


How to construct mapping? Using hash function


What is hash function?
Ex1)
	H(x) 	//what does it do?
		maps a key to whole number in fixed range

	H(x) = (x^2  -6x + 9) mod 10
			-> maps integer keys to range [0,9]
	can see
	H(4)= H(2)

Ex2)
H(S)
Converts string -> number
function H(S) :
  sum := 0
  for char in s:
       sum=  sum + ASCII(char)
  return sum mod 50


->ex H(BB) = (66 + 66)mod 50 = 32
