What is hash collision?
		  2 objects x and y , H(x) = H(y)
		2 keys having same index		
		//cant put 2 keys in same index, no space
For ex H(2)= H(8)

How to handle?
Hash collision resolution techniques

a) separate chaining
	What is separate chaining?
		a) store other key(s) in separate/auxillary data structure (LL usually, can use array/BT/SBT/Hybrid approach in java: once length reached -> switch to binary tree )
						//What is purpose of this auxillary DS? hold all collisions


b) open addressing
	What is open addressing?
		a) store other key(s) in same hash table
		b)
