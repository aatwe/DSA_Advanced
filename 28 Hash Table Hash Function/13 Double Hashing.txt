Q) What is double hashing?

P(k,x) = x*H2(k)
		//H2(k) : is second hashing function


input type of H2(k) = H1(k)
	string = string
	integer = integer

Double hashing is like linear probing 
	just that constant is unknown until runtime

so similar issues like linear probing : infinite cycle
