Basically : hash takes key input -> it gives us where to put key value pair so other person wont know where key value pair is unless he knows the key

What complexity of hash function?

//given: uniform hash function
if we use Hash function  to index into hash table
	What hash function gives? index
	lookup this index in table	
	What is hashtable? fancy array

Insertion:		 O(1)	//quick insertion and removal times
lookup		 O(1) 
Removal 		 O(1)
