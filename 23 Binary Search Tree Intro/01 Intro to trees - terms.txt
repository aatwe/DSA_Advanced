What are tree data structure?
	
	Undirected() graph	//each edge can be traversed both ways
What conditions trees must satisfy?
1) Acyclic Connected graph
		//connected: all vertices connected to each other by some path
		disconnected: atleast 2 vertices : not connected by any path

2) Connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges


3) any 2 vertices connected by ONLY 1 path	
		//if there were, it would create cycle



We discuss
	Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees



Q) What are rooted trees? What is root node
	top most node of tree //denoted by circle
	Any node of tree can be rooted

Q) What is a child and parent node? child node extends from parent node
		(extends = from parent to child)

Q) What is the parent of root node? root node has no parent / itself
//for file system parent of root node is root node itself
CLI : pwd
//how to go up to parent?\
	cd ../
//How to go total up?
	cd /

Q) What is a leaf node? node without any children

Q) What is subtree? tree entirely contained within another
	denote by triangles
	//subtree can have single node


Q) What are degenerate binary tree?
	every parent has just 1 child node
