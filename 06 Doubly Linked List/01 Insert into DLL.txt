How many pointers? 	//Note: DLL has pointers to next and previous node
Head : where pointing to? starting node
Tail : where pointing to? last node
trav : start from head node


algo?
1) seek trav pointer until node 1 before insertion position node found
2) create new node (to be added)
3) new node -> forward pointer points to insertion position node 
	        new node backward pointer points to trav node pointer(1 before the insertion position)

4) backward pointer of insertion place node point to new node
5) forward pointer of trav node  -> point to new node
