How many pointers?
a) Head
b) Tail
c) trav



Algo? Objective: remove 9 from DLL
1) where head point to? starting node
2) where tail point to? end node
3) where trav point to? starting node
4) seek trav until value node (to remove) 9 found 
5) point the forward pointer of node before trav node -> point to backward pointer of node after trav node
6) point backward pointer of node after trav node -> point to forward pointer of node before trav node		//node before trav and after trav are linked
7) remove trav node to avoid meory leak

9 is removed from DLL
