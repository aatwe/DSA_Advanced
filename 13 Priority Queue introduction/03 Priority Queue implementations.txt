Where used? Generally in graph theory algorithms
1) Dijkstra's Shortest path algo
	//what does it do? fetch next nodes to explore

2) Dynamically fetch next best / next worst element


3) Huffman Coding (Uses in lossless data compression) 

4)Best First Search (BFS) algo
	finds what? next most promising node

5) Prim's Minimum Spanning tree algo
	on directed graphs
