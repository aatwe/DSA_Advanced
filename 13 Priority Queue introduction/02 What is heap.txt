Tree based Data structure satisfying a property called heap property / heap variant
//Note heap be tree, cannot be structure //should not contain cycles
	
2 cases:
For alll nodes:
Rule a) value of parent node > value of child node	//MAX HEAP
						(binary heap)
					why? every node : 2 child
	Ex
	8				
           /	       \
      7	          6
   /     \	           |
3        2	          5

Rule b) value of parent node < value of child node	//MIN HEAP
	0					(binary heap)
           /	       \				why? every node : 2 child
      2	          3	
   /     \	       /	\
4        5	      6 	 4   


Q) why we studying heaps?
	heaps help find priority elements in pqueue
	heap is canonical underlying data structure for priority queue

	*sometime priority queue = heap


Q) Heap examples
a) Is it heap? no	
	does not satisfies heap invariant
	0					
           /	       \				
      2	          6	*	
   /     \	       /	\
4        5	      3	 4   
	
b) Is it heap? yes min heap
		satisfies heap invariant
	
		0

     1       1               1
   / |        |

c) Is below a valid heap? No, why? contain cycles

	8
           /	      \
       6	       6
    /       \     /       \
2	4            2	 



d) Is it heap? Yes

e) 	5

f) Is it heap?No
	does not satisfy heap variant

	10

If we modify to , Yes it is heap
