Q)  What is Priority Queue?
Stack and Queue were data structures

Priority queue is Abstract data type(meaning? can be implemented with other DS)
provides only interface adhering to data structure (How DS should behave, what methods to have)
						(Doesnt give the details)
	

Q) How different from normal queue?
Queue but every element has certain priority
in normal queue: we dequed the head element first
in priority queue: we deque higher priority element first
	what if same order? follow and dequeue in whatever order already


Q) What is the priority followed?
	smaller number -> higher priority
for ex		1         >	     2

Higher priority are removed first from queue(frontier)

SUMMARY
poll() in priority queue means : remove element with highest priority first from priority queue
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Ex
What priority below? higher ascii value , higher priority
	
insert (C)			C
insert (O)			C O
insert (D)			C O D
remove max		C D		//O removed
insert (I)			C D I
insert(N)			C D I N
remove max		C D I		//N removed
insert (G)			C D I G

Output priority queue:

Q) How is priority queue finding priority of elements and determining which element to remove?
we can see visually!

Machine uses HEAP to find priority elements

Q) What is heap?
