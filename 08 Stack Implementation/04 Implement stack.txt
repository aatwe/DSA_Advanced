1) Implement stack using SLL

What is Head? stack top
When is stack empty? head points to null
	what is null representing? bottom of stack


Where will we insert elements? Before the head of LL
	Why ? pointers point correct when we pop


Ex1)
push(4)
push(2)
push(5)
push(13)

head
13---> 5 ---> 2 ---> 4 ---> Null


How to pop elements?
move head pointer to next node and deallocate top node
how to deallocate in java?set node reference as null // java garbage collector picks up
	//why deallocate? to avoid memory leaks
	  memory leaks in DS worst!
