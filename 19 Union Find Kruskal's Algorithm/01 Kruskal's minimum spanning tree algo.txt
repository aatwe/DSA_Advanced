What is minimum spanning tree?

	What is Given? graph with vertices and edges

	What is minimum spanning tree?
	Subset of edges connecting all vertices at minimal cost

	basically 
	how to connect all vertices of the graph with minimum no. of edges



For ex
Given: 	Vertices
	Edges
	All are connected in a config

		        /	    6 \        / 0   
	F--------	G      -------     I

Objective? find possible minimum spanning tree
Solution:
Basically connected all points
total edge weight = 14 = minimum

Q) Does there exist only 1 min spanning tree? no can be many
We can have many similar minimum spanning trees
