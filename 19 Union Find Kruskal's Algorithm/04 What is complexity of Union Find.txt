Union find has 
Highly efficient complexity

a) Construction: O(n)

b) Union  :   	             α(n)	//Amortized constant time  complexity
		  //almost constant time

c) Find 	:   	             α(n)	//

d) Get Component Size :   α(n)

e) Check if connected   :    α(n)

f) Count components   :    O(1)
	How many


However earlier case didnt //not without path compression

Q) How to check if H and B are in same group or different?

	worst case: 5 hops	//Check final map
