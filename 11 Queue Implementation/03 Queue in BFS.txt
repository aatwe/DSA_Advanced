What is BFS?
operation on graph for graph traversal
	what is graph? a network of values

What is done in BFS?
	a) start at a node
	b) traverse entire graph / all nodes 
		How to traverse?
		a)  visit all neighbours of starting node
		b) all neighbours of first neighbour visited

	//overall explore one layer by layer


lets use 3 types of nodes
a) unvisited nodes
b) on frontier / layer nodes
c) visited nodes

BFS Algo
// how will we connect nodes? we use queue
1) Create a queue
//how do we travel from one node to another? add nodes in queue
//how to travel to first node? add first node in queue
2) Add first node to queue(travel to first node)
//how to mark this node is travelled? mark as visited
	2a) Mark first node as visited
Now find neighbours and make frontier layer for this node.// How to find neighbours for this node in queue?


3) Make it a frontier node(dequeue node from queue)
		a) Find all neighbours for queue
		b) travel to first neighbour(add to queue)
			b.1)  mark as visited
		c) travel to second neighbour(add to queue), 
			c.1)  mark as visited
 		...... do till all neighbour visited
		d) travel to last neighbour (add to queue), 
			d.1) mark as visited
		//frontier for node 1 explored
	//keep making frontier nodes (dequeing) till stack is empty //no more neighbours left
